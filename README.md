# Oasis-Frontend
Aplicación Frontend para el proyecto de impacto social

To use it, install and setup [Flutter on VSCode](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/quick_) and [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

After installing android studio, click on the app and go to more actions > Virtual Device Manager > Create Virtual Device.

(You can install a lighter device like a pixel 4a)

When you install the Flutter Extension in VSCode, open the project and type ```> Flutter: Select Device``` in the VSCode search bar and choose an Android Device.

After that, in the VSCode terminal, run ```flutter run```

On an android emulator, click the three dots and click on Location.

From there, you can set a location for flutter to retrieve as a current location.

**TODO LIST (FOR NOW)**:
1. ~~Add current location marker~~
2. ~~Paint mockup paths~~
3. ~~Update current location marker overtime~~
4. Add a feature to create path with either search bar or tap on the screen
5. Add zoom buttons
6. Add a path algorithm from current location to destiny location.
